This script needs to be run manually on some host - currently on
sdk-swarm-01.build.couchbase.com. That host must have files

    /home/couchbase/SPECIAL_SLAVES/jenkins_master_username
    /home/couchbase/SPECIAL_SLAVES/jenkins_master_password

containing the same data as the like-named secrets on the SDK
Docker swarm.

This is sadly necessary because the "cowbuilder" and "mock" slaves
must run with --privileged (or at least with some added capacities),
and Docker Swarm does not support these features.
