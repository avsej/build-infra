This directory contains Ansible configs for launching CV Linux slaves
which are hosted on separate VMs.

restart_cv_dockerslaves.yml - this is an Ansible playbook which does
the necessary steps to restart a single slave on port 2222 of a VM.
It expects the Ansible host to have /home/couchbase/jenkinsdocker-ssh
available, and will synchronize it to the host.

inventory - this is an Ansible inventory which specifies the current
set of VMs for these CV slaves.

host_vars - directory containing VM-specific configurations, such
as the Docker image name(s) to run on the VM.

The "go" script in this directory will run the playbook.
