Ansible playbook for configuring a base Ubuntu 16.04 server image with Docker.

Pre-requisites:
 - assumes a user "couchbase" with password "couchbase" and sudo privs
 - requires python to be installed (tested with "python" package - out of the
   box, Ubuntu 16.04 server has only python3 installed)

"go" is a convenience script to run this playbook.
